# line_follower_sensor_for_coloured_surfaces

The traditional line sensors are condition specific
which makes the robot follow a black or white line on white or
black surface respectively in the presence of uniform light
conditions. These drawbacks can be removed by designing a
sensor which is independent of the surface colour
specifications and ambient light.
